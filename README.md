--Computational Physics Projects compilation

This project was the result of a need to simulate complicated physical
phenomena using numerical methods where analytical solutions were difficult
or impossible to evaluate.

--Weather patterns(Butterfly pattern)
--Differential Equation solver( First and Second order differential equations )
--Monte carlo estimation methods for approximation integrals of complicated functions
--Runge-Kutta-2, Runge-Kutta-4 methods to evaluate integrals
